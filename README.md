### Bank Tech Test in Ruby

#### For this tech test I am required to build a simple banking app which can perform the following operations:

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see:

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

#### I will be attempting this in Ruby first today, then again in Javascript if the first goes well.
